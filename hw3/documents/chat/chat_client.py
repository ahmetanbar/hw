    This application is meant to be a chat client that connects to a central
    server. All messages are sent and received from the server. In order for the
    user to connect to the server, he or she must have a unique username that
    does not already exist on the server.
    Usage:
        python chat_client.py -c   -- cli mode
        python chat_client.py      -- gui mode
